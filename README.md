* Two-part, project-based program that focused on building real-world industry experience
* Simulated delivery of data insights & recommendations to various partner companies
* Completed certified capstone projects using actual data from The Recording Academy and Intel

### Projects
Honors Thesis Project
* Develop an interactive R Shiny webapp to simulate clinical trial outcomes under varying patient dropout scenarios
* Apply statistical methods to estimate treatment effects, adherence rates, and confidence intervals
* Produce a written analysis summarizing background, simulation design, app usage, key findings, and limitations

Data Driven Discovery Research Project
* Studied walk, trot, and canter gaits in horses using wireless IMUs (EquiMoves) and a Polar V800 heart rate monitor
* Attempted to process and synchronize accelerometer & heart rate data for integrated biomechanical analysis
* Explored gait asymmetry & heart rate variability to support objective lameness detection & rehabilitation strategies
