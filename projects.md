## Honors Thesis
**Description:** Clinical Trial Outcomes Simulation Under Patient Dropout Using R Shiny
• Develop an interactive R Shiny webapp to simulate clinical trial outcomes under varying patient dropout scenarios
• Apply statistical methods to estimate treatment effects, adherence rates, and confidence intervals
• Produce a written analysis summarizing background, simulation design, app usage, key findings, and limitations
**Technologies:** R Shiny
**Status:** In Progress
**Code:** [Link to your code]

## Data Driven Discovery Research Project
**Description:** IMU-Based Gait and Heart Rate Analysis in Horses Using EquiPro and Polar V800
• Studied walk, trot, and canter gaits in horses using wireless IMUs (EquiMoves) and a Polar V800 heart rate monitor
• Attempted to process and synchronize accelerometer & heart rate data for integrated biomechanical analysis
• Explored gait asymmetry & heart rate variability to support objective lameness detection & rehabilitation strategies
**Technologies:** EquiPro, Polar V800
**Status:** Complete
**Code:** [Link to your code]

## Data Engineering Final Project
**Description:** Transforming Spotify Data
• Extracted and cleaned Spotify artist & top tracks data using Spotipy, Pandas, and MySQL libraries
• Predicted time for top-streamed tracks to reach 1 billion streams by analyzing daily streaming rates
• Uploaded data to Amazon S3, stored it in AWS MySQL, and validated data integrity using SQL queries
**Technologies:** Jupyter Notebook, Spotipy, Pandas, MySQL, Amazon S3, AWS, SQL
**Status:** Complete
**Code:** [View Project](https://github.com/jennyygeng/jenny/tree/data-engineering-project)
